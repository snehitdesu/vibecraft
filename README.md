# FrictionSense AI

**FrictionSense AI** is an AI-powered system that detects the *invisible mental friction* behind procrastination and helps users overcome it in real time.  
Instead of assuming laziness, it identifies the true cognitive reason why a task is being avoided and applies the right intervention.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Tech students and working professionals often know exactly what they need to do, yet still fail to start or continue tasks.  
Current productivity tools and AI assistants focus on task management and motivation, but they do not understand **why a user is blocked**.

Procrastination is not caused by laziness — it is caused by hidden mental friction such as confusion, fear, overwhelm, or cognitive fatigue.  
No existing AI system can diagnose this friction in real time.

## ❌ Why Existing Tools Fail

- To-do apps treat all delays the same  
- AI planners provide generic motivation  
- Productivity tools ignore human psychology  
- Burnout and avoidance are detected too late  

There is no tool that identifies the *root cognitive cause* behind task avoidance.

## 💡 Our Solution – FrictionSense AI

FrictionSense AI acts as a cognitive debugger.  
It observes user behavior, detects task delays, asks smart diagnostic questions, and identifies the specific type of mental friction blocking action.

Instead of pushing users harder, it removes the obstacle.

## 🧠 Friction Types (Core Innovation)

FrictionSense AI classifies task avoidance into five friction types:

- **Clarity Friction** – User doesn’t know where to start  
- **Scale Friction** – Task feels too large or overwhelming  
- **Fear Friction** – Fear of failure or doing it wrong  
- **Energy Friction** – Mental fatigue or low cognitive energy  
- **Context Friction** – Too many distractions or task switching  

Each friction type requires a different solution.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User adds a task  
2. AI detects delay or task abandonment  
3. AI asks a quick diagnostic question  
4. User response identifies friction type  
5. AI adapts the task or workflow instantly
